# Causal Inference and Machine Learning Workshop
---

This repository contains the materials for the Causal Inference and Machine Learning Techniques workshop series.
---

Prerequisites 

Some prior experience with R is recommended and expected. Familiairty with basic statistical concepts such as regression and hypothesis testing is useful. Because causal inference relies on certain assumptions, basic familiarity with statistics and probability is expected.

Workshop Goals 

---

This two-part interactive workshop introduces participants to both causal inference using observational data and machine learning techniques to estimate treatment effects. The workshop is divided into two days: 

Day 1: Establishes causal inference concepts, with a focus on traditional statistical methods including matching, propensity-score mehtods, and instrumental variables. 
Day 2: Applies machine learning techniques, primarily causal trees and causal forests, to model heterogeneous treatment effects.

Learning Objectives 

After completing this workshop, you will be able to: 
 - Understand the potential outcomes framework and counterfactual thinking in causal inference
 - Apply matching methods to balance treatment and control groups, ensuring comparability.
 - Implement Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to control for confounders and estimate treatment effects in observational data
 - Check covariate balance and interpret the results to evaluate the quality of the matching process
 - Estimate treatment effects usign traditional (inferential) statistical methods, such as regression and matching.
 - Understand and apply Instrumental Variables (IV) techniques to address issues of endogeneity and unobserved confounding in causal inference
 - Estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using maching learning methods like causal trees and causal forests
 - Compare the advantages and limitations of traditional statistical methods vs. machine learning-based approaches for causal inference

Workshop Structure 

The Causal Inference and Machine Learning workshop is divided into two parts. Each part takes 2 hours and is devleieved in a lecture-style coding walkthrough with practical exercises, breaks, and interactive discussions.
