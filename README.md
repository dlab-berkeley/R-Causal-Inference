# Causal Inference and Machine Learning Workshop
---

This repository contains the materials for the Causal Inference and Machine Learning Techniques workshop series.
---

Prerequisites 

Some prior experience with R is recommended and expected. Familiairty with basic statistical concepts such as regression and hypothesis testing is useful. Because causal inference relies on certain assumptions, basic familiarity with statistics and probability is expected.

Workshop Goals 
--- 

This interactive workshop spans two days, focusing on causal inference using observational data and machine learning methods to model heterogeneous treatment effects.

Day 1: Establishes core causal inference concepts, including the potential outcomes framework and essential statistical techniques (e.g., propensity score matching) used for estimating treatment effects with observational data.
Day 2: Focuses on the application of machine learning methods to causal inference, introducing techniques such as causal trees and causal forests, emphasizing their use in identifying and interpreting heterogeneous treatment effects.

Learning Objectives 

After completing this workshop, you will be able to: 
- Understand the potential outcomes framework for causal inference.
- Apply Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to control for confounders and assess balance.
- Use instrumental variables for addressing unobserved confounding.
- Implement causal trees and causal forests for analyzing treatment effect heterogeneity.
- Compare traditional statistical and machine learning approaches to causal inference.

Workshop Structure 

The Causal Inference and Machine Learning workshop is divided into two parts. Each part takes 2 hours and is devleieved in a lecture-style coding walkthrough with practical exercises, breaks, and interactive discussions.
